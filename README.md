# Hyderabad-Metro-Data-Analysis
In this project, I have analyzed the Hyderabad Metro train transit data. The goal is to assess the data and explore potential solutions for addressing congestion in the metro trains.


Data Source:

The data is sourced from the Open Data Telangana portal (https://data.telangana.gov.in/). Users need to fill out a Google Form to access the data.

To better understand the project, a basic knowledge of the routes is essential. Familiarizing yourself with the route map will help in understanding the project. I have attached the route map for your reference.

Analysis Methodology:

The transit data provides information on train details, including train numbers, routes, and timings. The primary goal is to categorize the days into weekdays (WK), Saturdays (SA), and Sundays (SU), and to observe the frequency of trains on each route on these days.

Further observations and ideas for addressing the congestion problem are detailed in the analysis report.
